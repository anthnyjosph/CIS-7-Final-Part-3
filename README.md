Project General Description:

 Title: Doctors without Borders Matchmaker

 Description: The Doctors without Borders Matchmaker is a software solution designed to facilitate the pairing of medical graduates from the University of California Riverside with the Doctors without Borders program. The program aims to match participants based on language fluency, medical specialization, and country preferences, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of participant collaboration during on-site aid missions.

 Programming Approaches:

 The program is developed in C++ and leverages object-oriented programming principles. It employs a modular structure with classes representing participants and the matchmaker functionality. The algorithm calculates match probabilities based on language, specialization, and country attributes, with potential for future enhancements such as preference weighting, compatibility scoring, and machine learning models.
